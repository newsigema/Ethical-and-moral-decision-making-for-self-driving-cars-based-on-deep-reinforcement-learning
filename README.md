Abstract: Self-driving cars are anticipated to replace human drivers in the near future and promise significant societal benefits. However, they have encountered opposition from various organizations that argue it is difficult to respond to instances involving unavoidable personal injury. In unavoidable deadly collisions, the car must balance life and death decisions. This paper investigates the ethical and moral decision-making problem for self-driving cars from an algorithmic standpoint. The accident prioritized accident replay replay mechanism is introduced to the Rawlsian Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm based on early humanities research that was quantified as a reward function taking priority into account. The RGB (red, green, blue) images acquired by the camera installed in front of the self-driving cars are fed into the Xception network and used for training. In order to evaluate our approach, the conventional DQN algorithm is also presented for comparison. Simulation results indicate that the Rawlsian DQN algorithm has more excellent stability and interpretability in decision-making, and the majority of respondents to our survey accept the final choice. The experiment demonstrates that it is possible to incorporate ethical considerations into self-driving car decision-making, providing a solution for rational decision-making in emergency and dilemma circumstances.
